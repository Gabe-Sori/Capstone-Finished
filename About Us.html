        <h2 class="group1">Hi my name is Gabriel Soriano and I was born in San Juan, <a href="https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/" target="_blank"> Puerto Rico</a>. <br> My parents  are from the <a href="https://www.godominicanrepublic.com/" target="_blank"> Dominican Republic </a> making me not just Puerto <br> Rican but also Dominican. I was raised in Puerto Rico for 4 years which <br> at the age of 4, I moved to America. That's when I had to start all over <br> again: making new friends, learning a new language, getting used to the <br> enviroment and exploring a whole new city. Because of this my mom took <br> my brother and I to every borough. The borough that I had the most fun <br> in was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" target="_blank">Manhattan</a> because that's where my mom took us to go ice skating <br> (ice skating is one of my favorite hobbies).</h2>
